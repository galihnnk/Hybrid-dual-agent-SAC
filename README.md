Troubleshooting
Common Issues
Density Adaptation Not Working
[WARNING] Density 600 exceeds realistic maximum (480), capped to gridlock scenario
Solution: The system automatically caps unrealistic densities. This is expected behavior.
Channel Model Conflicts
[ERROR] Unknown channel model in density configuration
Solution: Ensure density estimation is within realistic bounds (60-480 vehicles/km).
Training Instability in High Density
[TRAINING] Very high neighbor count affecting convergence
Solution: Use ConservativeTrainingConfig for high-density scenarios, or reduce max_neighbors.
Performance Optimization
Poor High-Density Performance

Use AggressiveTrainingConfig with strong power penalties
Increase cooperation weights (W5) for better coordination
Monitor C-NLOS-ENH channel adaptation

Inefficient Low-Density Coverage

Reduce power penalties for coverage optimization
Increase beacon rate rewards for connectivity
Use AWGN/R-LOS optimized parameters
